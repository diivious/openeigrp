# EIGRP Tools

These scripts support the split source layout where portable EIGRP code lives in
`eigrp/code/`, FRR adapters live in `frr/code/`, and `frr-install.sh` assembles the two
into the FRR checkout. FRR-specific
development tooling uses the `frr-` prefix so a future host can provide its own
parallel driver, such as `bird.sh`.

This file is the operator/developer cookbook for FRR stage, build, and UUT.
Contribution rules are in `../CONTRIBUTING.md`. The FRR file map is in
`../frr/README.md`. A new non-FRR host should not start here; start in
`../specs/platform-integration.md`.

## Scripts

```text
frr.sh          Primary FRR development driver: smoke, install, patch, configure, build, check, UUT, clean.
frr-named-uut.sh  Live named-mode config/writeback test using sudo vtysh -d eigrpd.
frr-install.sh  Assemble eigrp/code/ + frr/code/ into FRR, install FRR-native tests, and apply frr/patch/.
frr-setup.sh    Debian development-machine setup helper.
frr-uut.sh      Build the FRR UUT, then run EIGRP tests; can drive a remote Linux UUT.
backup.sh       Create a clean project zip.
```

All script options use GNU-style `--long-option` arguments.

## FRR development workflow

Stage source into FRR through the primary driver:

```sh
tools/frr.sh --install --frr-root ~/devel/frr
```

This assembles portable `eigrp/code/` source plus the FRR adapter files in
`frr/code/` into FRR's single `eigrpd/` directory and stages `frr/test/eigrpd/`. Staging is
always performed with `--no-patches`.

Patch ownership is explicit. `tools/frr.sh --patch` is the only primary-driver
action that applies the managed FRR-wide patch series. Install, configure,
build, check, all, and UUT actions only restage the EIGRP source/test payloads
and never modify FRR-wide source. Patch application itself remains idempotent:
an already-applied patch is detected with a reverse `git apply --check`, while
an FRR source conflict stops the patch action for review.

```sh
tools/frr.sh --install --frr-root ~/devel/frr
tools/frr.sh --patch --frr-root ~/devel/frr
```

Run the standalone compile smoke:

```sh
tools/frr.sh --smoke
```

Configure and build FRR after staging EIGRP:

```sh
tools/frr.sh --configure --frr-root ~/devel/frr
tools/frr.sh --build --frr-root ~/devel/frr
```

Run the full configure/build/check gate:

```sh
tools/frr.sh --all --frr-root ~/devel/frr
```

Stage the current EIGRP source, build, install, restart FRR, and run the live
named-mode configuration UUT against `eigrpd`:

```sh
tools/frr.sh --uut --frr-root ~/devel/frr
```

The live UUT uses `sudo vtysh -d eigrpd -c ...` for every operation. It is
intentionally staged so configuration/runtime defects are isolated instead of
being hidden by a large matrix. Stage 1 creates only `router eigrp savage` /
IPv4 AS 4453 and runs the complete applicable command, mutation, no-form, and
writeback suite. Only after IPv4/4453 passes does Stage 2 add IPv6 AS 4453 and
run the applicable IPv6 suite. Stage 3 then adds IPv4/IPv6 AS 6473 to verify
multiple autonomous-system contexts and `no address-family`. Stage 4 finally
verifies that `savage` and `SAVAGE` are distinct named processes.
`frr.sh --uut` does not apply managed FRR patches. Required patch state must
already be present before the UUT is run. As its first preflight step it prints
any existing `eigrpd` processes and terminates stale daemon instances (TERM,
then KILL if required) before staging/building the new UUT. A true defunct
process entry is reported but does not fail the run because it cannot retain
daemon sockets or runtime state. The command installs the just-built FRR tree
and restarts the `frr` systemd service before invoking vtysh so the current
daemon/build artifacts are exercised. Set `EIGRP_UUT_INTERFACE` when the test
interface is not `enp0s8`.

## UUT workflow

`frr-uut.sh` is the aggregate/local-or-remote UUT entry point. A UUT test run
always stages and builds the current EIGRP source before executing the selected
tests. This staging is performed without patch application. If the build fails,
tests are not run. The `--all` and `--frr` selections
run the same live named-mode configuration test used by `frr.sh --uut` before
any FRR-native pytest payload.

On a Linux machine that is itself the UUT:

```sh
tools/frr-uut.sh --frr-root ~/devel/frr
```

From another development host, sync the project to a remote Linux UUT, build
there, and run the tests there:

```sh
tools/frr-uut.sh --host uut --frr-root '~/devel/frr'
```

The quotes around a remote `~/...` path keep the local shell from expanding it
before the path is sent to the UUT.

The default test set is `--all`. Test subsets are available when needed:

```sh
tools/frr-uut.sh --packet   --frr-root ~/devel/frr
tools/frr-uut.sh --portable --frr-root ~/devel/frr
tools/frr-uut.sh --frr      --frr-root ~/devel/frr
```

These still build the UUT first. For a source-only portable test without an FRR
build, use the project test target directly:

```sh
make uut
```

To force bootstrap/configure before the UUT build:

```sh
tools/frr-uut.sh --configure-first --frr-root ~/devel/frr
```

To build the UUT without executing tests:

```sh
tools/frr-uut.sh --build-only --frr-root ~/devel/frr
```

## Local snapshot helper

`backup.sh` is a local snapshot tool for the maintainer. It is not how
contributions are sent. Send a GitHub pull request. See `../CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Local FRR service commands

```sh
sudo systemctl restart frr
sudo systemctl status frr
```

## Handy `vtysh` commands

```sh
vtysh -c 'show running-config'
vtysh -c 'configure terminal' -c 'service integrated-vtysh-config' -c 'end' -c 'write memory'
vtysh -c 'debug eigrp packet hello' -c 'debug eigrp packet update' -c 'debug eigrp transmit ack' -c 'debug eigrp transmit packetize'
vtysh -c 'configure terminal' -c 'router eigrp 4453' -c 'network 10.0.0.0/8' -c 'network 172.16.0.0/24' -c 'network 192.168.1.0/24'
```

## Manual eigrpd UUT startup

For UUT runs, `/etc/frr/daemons` is not changed. `eigrpd` may remain `no`; after the FRR service is restarted, the UUT starts `eigrpd` manually through FRR's installed `frrcommon.sh` daemon helper. This deliberately keeps `eigrpd` outside `watchfrr`, so killing the daemon during development does not cause watchfrr to respawn it.
